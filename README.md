This repository collects demos that show how you might use [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) together with an LLM like GPT-4. It is very much a work in progress, please use it as inspiration and experimentation.

To use the current starter demos:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of this repository with the following contents:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-sk-etcetcetc
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_etcetcetc
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-etcetcetc
VITE_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_etcetcetc
```

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server

See the demos in the `src/demos` folder

PRs welcome for new demos, prompts, strategies and models.
